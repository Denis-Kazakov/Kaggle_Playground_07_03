# Kaggle Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 7

Notebooks are numbered consequtively. The first three are trial runs on a similar data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/reservation-cancellation-prediction)

I tried individual estimators and various ensembles, with xgboost as the best performer.

Originally, I selected hyperparameters by several rounds of grid search. At the end, I tried more advanced algorithms: halving search and Bayesian search with a small improvement of performance.
